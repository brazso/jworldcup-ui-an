Each game belongs to an international football tournament, for example a world cup. A tournament consists of matches and those results must be tipped. Each user may select an favourite teams for the group stage and another one for the knockout stage. Player gets double score if her bet wins on a match where her favourite team is involved. The results of the players can be checked during the tournament, after the event a certificate of merit can be printed to prove the player's result. Any user can create an user group where her buddies can be added to. The results also can be viewed of these user groups, so smaller companies can be played isolated from the others. There is a top players list where the best performances of all tournaments are displayed globally. Based on an balanced calculation, the player's results of all finished events are sorted and the best ones are shown here.</p>",

When the group stage is over, a new favourite team should be selected for the knockout stage.&nbsp; It can be done before the starting time of the first match of the knockout stage.
